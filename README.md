# Matify AI — Reimagining math solving through drawing and AI 🧠✏️

Matify AI is a Next.js (v14) web app that lets users draw math problems on a canvas and get precise LaTeX solutions via Google GenAI (Gemini). It combines an interactive Excalidraw-powered whiteboard with rich text editing, user auth, and Convex as the backend datastore.

Key features
- Draw math problems and get immediate LaTeX solutions using Google Gemini.
- Excalidraw whiteboard for freeform math notation and diagrams.
- EditorJS-powered document editor for notes and structured content.
- Auth via Kinde, persistent data via Convex, and server-side GenAI integration.

---

## Stack
- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- React 18
- Tailwind CSS + Tailwind Animations
- Excalidraw for canvas / whiteboard
- @google/genai (Gemini API) for math recognition and solving
- Convex for backend database and realtime features
- Kinde for authentication
- EditorJS for document editing

---

## Quick Start — Local Development ✅
Prerequisites
- Node >= 18 (recommended)
- (Optional) pnpm, yarn, or npm

1) Install dependencies

```powershell
npm install
```

2) Create a `.env.local` file in the project root and add required secrets (see Environment Variables below)

3) Start the dev server

```powershell
npm run dev
```

4) Visit http://localhost:3000

---

## Environment variables
Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with the following variables:

```env
# Convex
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=your_convex_realtime_url

# Google Gemini API Key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_genai_api_key

# Kinde auth (Replace values based on your Kinde app)
NEXT_PUBLIC_KINDE_SITE_URL=https://your-kinde-app.kinde.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_KINDE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
KINDE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
# … other Kinde variables described in your Kinde dashboard
```

💡 Tip: Replace keys with secret values. Never commit secrets to git.

## Scripts
- npm run dev — starts Next.js dev server
- npm run build — builds for production
- npm run start — runs production build
- npm run lint — run linters

## Feature Overview

- Whiteboard (Excalidraw)
	- Users can draw math equations, geometry, and diagrams.
	- The canvas can be exported and is captured to a Base64 image which is sent to `/api/calculate`.

- AI OCR + Solver (/api/calculate)
	- This endpoint sends a base64 PNG to the Google GenAI (Gemini) model with a system prompt that enforces LaTeX-only output.
	- The server returns a LaTeX string back to the client to render via `react-latex-next`.

- Documents (EditorJS)
	- EditorJS provides a structured document editor that saves content to Convex.

- Auth & Users
	- Kinde provides login/register flow.
	- On dashboard access, the app ensures a user record exists in Convex and creates one if necessary.

## Key Files & Architecture

- `app/` — Next.js App Router pages and components
	- `app/page.tsx` — Landing page with `Header` and `Hero`
	- `app/_components/Canvas.tsx` — Excalidraw integration and calculations
	- `app/_components/Editor.tsx` — EditorJS integration for notes
	- `app/_components/AiOutput.tsx` — Displays LaTeX output from the AI
	- `app/ConvexClientProvider.tsx` — Convex client setup

- `app/api/calculate/route.js` — Server route for AI generation (GEMINI_API_KEY required)
- `convex/` — Convex functions, e.g., `convex/volume.tsx` for volumes/whiteboard persistence

---

## Deployment

You can deploy the app to Vercel or any platform that supports Node 18 and Next.js 14. If you’re using Vercel, set the environment variables there, and the default `build` and `start` scripts will work.

---

## Security & Privacy
- The project uses Google GenAI to process user-drawn images; ensure you follow the Terms of Service and don't send PII without notice.
- Keep API keys and other secrets out of source control.

---

## Contributing
- Feature requests, bug reports, and PRs are welcome.
- Please open issues and use branches for any new work.

Suggested workflow:
- Fork → branch → implement → PR → code review

---

## TODO / Roadmap
- Add automated tests and CI pipeline
- Add a production-grade deployment guide (Vercel + environment management)
- Improve solution validation, error handling, and user feedback

## License & Attribution
No license is specified in this repository — add a `LICENSE` file if you wish to publish under a specific license (e.g., MIT).
